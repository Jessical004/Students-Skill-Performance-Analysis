# Students Skill/Performance Analysis
## by Jessica Chizoba Nkwa


## Dataset

> PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.
Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.



## Summary of Findings

> The vast majority of pupils attend elementary school for more than a year. 
> The primary education of students contributes to their performance in their examinations
> Various students' performances in math, science, and reading seem to be correlated 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Early Education Influence on Student performance in Academics
> Influence of Primary Education of Student Academic Performance
> Effect of Parent Academic Degree on Students Performance
> Effect of Parent Employment Status on Student Performance
> Parent Earning effect on Student Education Performance
